## Vishing

Vishing, short for **"voice phishing,"** is a social engineering attack that **involves manipulating individuals over the phone to divulge sensitive information, such as personal identification numbers (PINs), credit card numbers, or login credentials.** Vishing attackers often impersonate legitimate organizations or authorities to gain the trust of their targets.

## Spam

Spam refers to **unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent over electronic communication channels, such as email, instant messaging, or social media.** These messages are typically sent in bulk to a large number of recipients, with the primary intention of advertising products, services, or spreading malware. Spam can be a nuisance and a security threat, as it consumes network bandwidth, clutters inboxes, and can sometimes contain phishing attempts or malicious attachments.

## Spim

Spim, short for "instant messaging spam," is a type of unsolicited and unwanted communication sent through instant messaging (IM) platforms or applications. Similar to email spam, spim consists of bulk messages that often contain advertisements, phishing attempts, or links to malicious websites. Spim can be a nuisance and a potential security threat to users of IM services.
