Security and Information Life Cycle
security involved in every phase
data collection -> consent
implementation

Phases:
Collection -> Store -> Process -> Sharing -> Delete/Disposal

Privacy Enhancing Tech

Anonymization
Pseudo-anonymization - replacing PII with fake identifiers
data minimization - limit sensitive data that is being stored/retained
tokenization - digital token that authorizes access instead of original credentials
data maskin - hiding sensitive data from unauthorized users / masked out passwords or credit card info

Sovereignty
Location of data and laws applied to data

Data Desctruction
failed or decommisioned devices
storage end of life policies

Digital Media sanitation
data is still recoverable
deleted files, re-partitioned or reformatted drives

disk wiping tools
ssd and hd (degaussing \*HD only)

cryptographic erasure
destroy storage media decryption key

Personnel Risk and Policies

Personnel MGT Policies
SOP
Separation of Duties (multi person control)
reduce fraud and collusion

Employee Contractor Hiring
SocMed Analysis / scraping
web search
background check

User Onboarding
NDA
security policy awareness
user account and resource access
issue security badge

User Habits
clean desk policies
physical and digital document shredding - mitigates dumpster diving
personally owned devices - MDM policy
BYOD policy

User Training
Ongoing, role based
CBT
Gamification -> capture the flag /phishing campaign /simulation

User Offboarding
termination letter
exit interview
return of equipment
knowlege transfer
account disablement vs deletion

Third Party Risk Management

- Measurement Systems Analysis -> can identify supply chain improvements
- Supply Chain Security Risks
- Hardware and software vendors
  - EOL or EOSL -> no more security updates / patches
  - Cloud service providers security compliance
  - contractors
  - company mergers and system linking
  - devs that use third party components/libraries

Data Loss Prevention

- reduce intentional/unintentional senstive data exfiltration

Agreement Types

- Interconnection Security Agreement
  - legal review, regulatory compiance
  - linking companies
  - vulnerability scans
  - mandatory training / certifications
  - Input from IT Security
- Service Level Agreement
  - guarantee service uptime
- Memorandum of Understading
  - broad terms of agreement between parties
- Memorandum of Agreemeent
  - Detailed terms between parties
- Business Partnership agreement
  - legal document
  - responsibilities, investment and decision making
- Non-disclosure Agreement
  - prevent sensitive data or trade secrets to be disclosed externally

UTM

- Unified Threat Management

STIX

- structured threat information expression defines a standard format used to express threat intelligence data.

HSM

- hardware security module is a cryptographic tamper-proof appliance used to carry out cryptographic operations.

PKI

- Public Key Infrastrusture is a heirarchy of digital security certificates

TAXII

- Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence is a standard that deifnes how threat intelligence information is relayed from sources to subscribers
