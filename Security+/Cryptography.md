# Cryptography Basics

- putting confidentiality in information
- Obfuscation (take something that make sense and hide it )
  - diffusion: allows info to be less obvious
  - confusion: confusing information

encryption / decryption: cryptography is the process of encrypting and decrypting information about

Cryptonalysis: breaking crypted code

Caesar Cipher:

- substitution:
  - rot2
  - rot3
- cons: too easy to predict

Vigenere Cipher:

- caesar cipher with extra confustion involved
- cons: only for alphabet
- components :
  - Algorithm: caesar cipher
  - Key for encryption: allows changes for encryption
