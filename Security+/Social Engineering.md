---

## Principles of Social Engineering

- Authority
- Intimidation
- Consensus / Social Proof
- Scarcity
- Urgency
- Familiarity / Liking
- Trust

**Social Engineering can:**

- constantly changing
- may involve multiple people
- may be in person or electronic

## Phishing

A cyberattack technique where **attackers send fraudulent emails, messages, or websites to deceive individuals into revealing sensitive information, such as usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, or personal details**. The message **often mimic legitimate entities,** like banks, social platforms, or trusted organizations, to \*\*trick recipients into taking actions that compromise their security

### Smishing

Smishing is a form of cyber attack that involves sending fraudulent text messages (SMS) or multimedia messages (MMS) to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or taking certain actions, such as clicking on malicious links or downloading malicious apps.

### Vishing

Vishing, short for **"voice phishing,"** is a social engineering attack that **involves manipulating individuals over the phone to divulge sensitive information, such as personal identification numbers (PINs), credit card numbers, or login credentials.** Vishing attackers often impersonate legitimate organizations or authorities to gain the trust of their targets.

### Typo Squatting

also known as URL hijacking or domain squatting, is a cyber attack technique where attackers register domain names that are intentionally similar to legitimate and commonly visited websites.

### Pre Texting

a form of social engineering where an attacker creates a fabricated scenario or pretext to manipulate individuals into providing sensitive information, such as personal details, account credentials, or financial information

### Pharming

a cyber attack technique that involves redirecting or manipulating the Domain Name System (DNS) to point users to fraudulent websites without their knowledge or consent. Unlike phishing, which relies on tricking individuals into clicking on malicious links, pharming involves compromising the DNS infrastructure to redirect legitimate web addresses to malicious IP addresses.

### Spear Phishing vs Whaling

**Spear phishing** is a targeted form of phishing attack in which cybercriminals customize their deceptive messages to a specific individual, organization, or group of individuals while **Whaling** is a specific type of spear phishing that targets high-profile individuals within an organization, such as top executives or senior management. The goal is to compromise the accounts of these individuals due to their access to sensitive information and their potential impact on the organization

## Impersonation

a deceptive technique in which an attacker poses as someone else, either digitally or in person, with the intent to deceive, manipulate, or exploit individuals, organizations, or systems. Impersonation can take various forms, including online impersonation through social engineering, email spoofing, or the creation of fake profiles, as well as in-person impersonation where an attacker physically pretends to be someone else.

## Shoulder Surfing

Shoulder surfing is a type of visual eavesdropping technique in which an attacker observes the activities or information entered by a person, such as passwords, PINs, or sensitive data, by looking over their shoulder or from a distance. This method doesn't involve any technical hacking but relies on the attacker's ability to physically see or record information being entered by the victim

## Dumpster Diving

a physical intrusion technique where attackers search through discarded materials, such as trash containers, dumpsters, or recycling bins, to find sensitive information. This information may include discarded documents, hardware, or other materials that can be used to gain unauthorized access to systems, conduct identity theft, or exploit vulnerabilities

## Hoaxes

a deliberately fabricated deception or false information presented as real or true, often with the intent to mislead or trick individuals. Hoaxes can take various forms, including false rumors, fake news articles, misleading emails, or social media posts. The purpose of a hoax can range from creating panic or confusion to spreading misinformation for ideological, political, or malicious reasons.

## Water Hole Attacks

a type of cyber attack in which the attacker compromises a website that the targeted individuals or organization is likely to visit. The term "watering hole" is derived from predators that wait near watering holes for their prey. Similarly, in a cyber context, attackers infect a website frequented by their targets, exploiting vulnerabilities to deliver malware and compromise the systems of visitors.

## Influence Campaign

a coordinated effort to shape public opinion, behaviors, or decisions through strategic communication, often involving the spread of information or disinformation. These campaigns can be conducted by various entities, including governments, political groups, or other organizations, and may use a combination of traditional and digital media to achieve their goals. Influence campaigns can target individuals, communities, or entire societies with the aim of swaying opinions, creating division, or achieving specific outcomes

## Spam

Spam refers to **unsolicited and often irrelevant or inappropriate messages sent over electronic communication channels, such as email, instant messaging, or social media.** These messages are typically sent in bulk to a large number of recipients, with the primary intention of advertising products, services, or spreading malware. Spam can be a nuisance and a security threat, as it consumes network bandwidth, clutters inboxes, and can sometimes contain phishing attempts or malicious attachments.

### Spim

Spim, short for "instant messaging spam," is a type of unsolicited and unwanted communication sent through instant messaging (IM) platforms or applications. Similar to email spam, spim consists of bulk messages that often contain advertisements, phishing attempts, or links to malicious websites. Spim can be a nuisance and a potential security threat to users of IM services.

## Tailgating

Use an authorized person to gain unauthorized access to a building, security doors, office

## Invoice Scams

Fake invoice, starts with a bit of spear phishing

## Credential Harvesting

Also called password harvesting. Attackers will collect your login credentials.
