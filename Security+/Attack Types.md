### Virus vs Worms

A **virus** is malware that can reproduce itself, but one of the unique characteristics of a virus is that it needs you– the end user– to click on or launch that application to start the virus replication process. This is something that differentiates a virus from a worm. The virus needs a human being to start the process, whereas a **worm** can jump from machine to machine without any human intervention whatsoever. Once the end user has launched the executable that starts the virus, it can use the existing file system or the network to replicate itself.
